HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the web. It is a protocol that enables communication between clients and servers on the internet. HTTP is used to request and transmit data between web clients and servers.

HTTP has undergone several versions since it was first introduced. The latest version is HTTP/2, which was standardized in 2015. HTTP/2 is the successor to HTTP/1.1, which was standardized in 1997.

In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of HTTP. It is a simple, text-based protocol that uses a request-response model for communication between clients and servers. In HTTP/1.1, the client sends a request to the server, and the server sends a response back to the client.

HTTP/1.1 supports various methods for making requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It also supports different types of data, including text, images, and videos.

One of the key limitations of HTTP/1.1 is that it is a connection-oriented protocol. This means that a new connection is established for each request-response cycle. This can lead to inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks, especially when a large number of requests need to be made.

HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is the latest version of the HTTP protocol. It was designed to overcome the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and improve the performance of the web.

HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, which means that it uses binary data instead of text for communication. This makes it more efficient and easier to parse.

Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 is a multiplexed protocol. This means that it supports multiple requests and responses over a single connection. This eliminates the need for establishing a new connection for each request, which can improve performance and reduce latency.

Another key feature of HTTP/2 is that it supports server push. This allows the server to send additional resources to the client proactively, without the need for a request from the client. This can further improve performance by reducing the number of round trips between the client and server.

Conclusion
In summary, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are different versions of the HTTP protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a simple, text-based protocol that uses a request-response model and establishes a new connection for each request. HTTP/2 is a binary, multiplexed protocol that supports server push and can improve performance by reducing the number of round trips between the client and server.



objects and its internal representation in Javascript

In JavaScript, objects are used to store and manipulate data. An object is a collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value. The value of a property can be any data type, including primitive types such as numbers and strings, as well as more complex types such as arrays and other objects.

Objects are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and they are used extensively in many different contexts. For example, objects are used to represent data in web applications, to define the behavior of classes in object-oriented programming, and to store configuration data and settings.

In this blog post, we will take a closer look at how objects are represented internally in JavaScript.

Object literals
One of the simplest ways to create an object in JavaScript is using an object literal. An object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs enclosed in curly braces

Object internal representation
When we create an object using an object literal, JavaScript internally creates an object with a hidden internal property called [[Prototype]]. This property points to a prototype object that contains the default properties and methods inherited by the object.

Conclusion
In conclusion, objects are an important concept in JavaScript. They are used to store and manipulate data, and they have a hidden internal representation that includes
