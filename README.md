HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the web. It is a protocol that enables communication between clients and servers on the internet. HTTP is used to request and transmit data between web clients and servers.

HTTP has undergone several versions since it was first introduced. The latest version is HTTP/2, which was standardized in 2015. HTTP/2 is the successor to HTTP/1.1, which was standardized in 1997.

In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of HTTP. It is a simple, text-based protocol that uses a request-response model for communication between clients and servers. In HTTP/1.1, the client sends a request to the server, and the server sends a response back to the client.

HTTP/1.1 supports various methods for making requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It also supports different types of data, including text, images, and videos.

One of the key limitations of HTTP/1.1 is that it is a connection-oriented protocol. This means that a new connection is established for each request-response cycle. This can lead to inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks, especially when a large number of requests need to be made.

HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is the latest version of the HTTP protocol. It was designed to overcome the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and improve the performance of the web.

HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, which means that it uses binary data instead of text for communication. This makes it more efficient and easier to parse.

Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 is a multiplexed protocol. This means that it supports multiple requests and responses over a single connection. This eliminates the need for establishing a new connection for each request, which can improve performance and reduce latency.

Another key feature of HTTP/2 is that it supports server push. This allows the server to send additional resources to the client proactively, without the need for a request from the client. This can further improve performance by reducing the number of round trips between the client and server.

Conclusion
In summary, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are different versions of the HTTP protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a simple, text-based protocol that uses a request-response model and establishes a new connection for each request. HTTP/2 is a binary, multiplexed protocol that supports server push and can improve performance by reducing the number of round trips between the client and server.
